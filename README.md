This is the repository for identifying bubble cluster configurations to produce the probability distribution.

# Motivation:

In condensed matter physics one of the most important and open questions involves understanding the mechanical response of materials. With different structural features, solid materials can be classified into two main groups: crystalline materials and amorphous materials. Crystalline materials refer to substances that are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure. This type of material is often very rare in the natural environment, an example of which are diamonds. In the crystalline case, the mechanical response is well described by theoretical models, due to their highly ordered structure. One can easily imagine that the deformation of the crystalline structure under an applied force tends to occur near structural defects. This is because the surrounding local structure is relatively less stable. However, most materials exist in the nature are considered to be amorphous. In contrast to their crystalline counterpart, there is no long-range structural ordering. This is due to their intrinsic structural complexity, which makes it challenging to precisely predict the mechanical response under an applied force, especially as it pertains to understanding the structural transformation at the microscale. 

One of the methods used to study this essential question is to decompose an amorphous structure into sub-units (clusters) based on their stability. In the analog to the crystalline defects, recognizing the less stable local cluster is equivalent to identifying the weak zone in the larger structure. From here we can begin to understand the relationship between the structural feature and the deformation of amorphous materials under an applied force. Thus studying the stability of clusters is crucial to further our understanding of this behavior. 

In our experiment, we use bubbles to generate clusters at the air-water interface to study their stability. Bubble rafts have been used as a model system in many past research projects, due to the similarity of the particle-particle based attraction to atomic interaction. Also, it provides us the capability to directly observe the microstructure which is very rare in other systems. With the benefit of using bubbles to create clusters, we are able to collect massive data sets in the form of images to analyze their stability in a controlled laboratory setting.
